                        <p>Design is everywhere.  Before I even sit down at my desk, I’ve interacted with so many designs - a shampoo bottle, a food package, a news article, an online order, an email, a streaming service, the daycare app, something in my social feed. The list goes on.  When I’m drawn to something or it’s aesthetically pleasing, I take a mental note, a photo, or a screenshot and think about why I am attracted to it. Was it the color palette, the ease of use, the white space, the clear directions, the branding, etc. Or maybe it was a poor experience that left me frustrated. What could make it better? I then apply this mindset to my canvas as I design with the end user in mind. How can I create the best experience for them?</p>

Adobe XD has a coediting feature which allows me to invite other designers into my files so we can collaborate and design together in real time. Also, briefs, copy docs, and design mockups are all open to feedback and commenting.</p>

                        <p>When designing for the web, the primary goal is to provide the user with the most relevant content in a clear and easy to navigate manner. Recently I have been exploring ways to improve the user experience as a user moves throughout our product ecosystem. Adding breadcrumbs and a secondary navigation, for example, can provide the user more context to where they are in the ecosystem while also allowing the user to easily navigate to other sections.</p>

                        <p>Something else that is always in the back of my mind when designing, is how will this design look in another language? While we design webpages in English, most of our pages are translated to 8 other languages. This means we need to consider character counts and how certain languages may expand within a layout when translated.</p>
